I hope you enjoyed it!!! also, if u havent, u should TOTALLY check out my YouTube channel after this. I don't just make fnf and Undertale fanart you know, im a PRO at cs:go. so if u want to watch me pwn some noobs... subscribe to me!!!! I do sub 4 sub o7. also, if you couldn't tell, i LOVE temmie. temmie from undertale.. I'm genuinely obsessed with this little character, it started when i played Undertale for the first time as a 12 year old. when i saw this little cute motherfucker come up to me, SHIVERING to the point where her face leaves her body, there's no way I couldn't relate to that. it had gotten to the point where i started to sell my home-made temmie flakes at school, to fund my college education.. I didn't even want to go to college before this!! but here i am. you guys should definitely play undertale if you haven't, it's on every signle platform ever at this point and im glad. i can take temmie wherever i want.. also, speaking of school, my GOD is it stressful.. i had to stop working on this mod for a couple weeks just because of essays and finals! it's so dumb, can't they just leave me alone.. i really hope i can graduate this year, or the next, or the year after that (i have failed to graduate several times), but enough with that stuff.... there was this one moment where i went to an anime convention, dressed up as temmie (who would've guessed) and there was this other dude in a bob costume, and we really connected with each other.... it was as if he was my long lost brother.. unfortunately I didn't get to ask him for his socials so i never met him again... Bob guy, if you're reading this, please give me back my fucking wallet you son of a bitch"
